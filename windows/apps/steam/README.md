## Starting Steam minimized
Create a shortcut to steam with an option `-silent` and run it on startup

## Setting default library
(_Use only if setting the default library in Steam Library Folders does not work_)

Symlink the default steam library folder on "C" drive to a folder on another drive. Then your games will be downloaded to that other drive.
